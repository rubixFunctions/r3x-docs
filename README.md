# Welcome to RubiX - Functions as a Container
This work was carried out as a Final Year Project, as part of the Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Applied Computing. The end result of this project will be a Framework which provides a suite of SDKâ€™s and a CLI that will reduce the barrier of entry to serverless development within Knative, by abstracting the boring bits and allowing you to focus on your functions.

## Components
- SDK - Abstracts the configuration away from the user allowing you to focus on the logic behind your function.
- CLI - A command line tool to bootstrap Functions as a Container.
