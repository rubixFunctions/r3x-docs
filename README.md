[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/s/Apache-2.0)

This work was carried out as a Final Year Project, as part of the Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Applied Computing. The end result of this project will be a Framework which provides a suite of SDKâ€™s and a CLI that will reduce the barrier of entry to serverless development within Knative, by abstracting the boring bits and allowing you to focus on your functions.

## Components
- [SDK](https://github.com/rubixFunctions/r3x-js-sdk) - Abstracts the configuration away from the user allowing you to focus on the logic behind your function.
- [CLI](https://github.com/rubixFunctions/r3x-cli) - A command line tool to bootstrap Functions as a Container.

## Getting Started
- [Installing Knative and Deploying a r3x Function](./install/README.md)
- [Using the RubiX CLI](./cli/README.md)
